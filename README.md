The Wikibase Design System and home of WMDE-supported component implementations.

## Development

The following examples use `docker` and `docker-compose` to ease creating a level playing field for development but they are not essential to this project.

### Building the Docker image

```sh
# ensure the node user uses your user id, so you own created files
docker-compose build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) node
```

### Running npm

```sh
docker-compose run --rm node npm
```

### Installation

This project uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to orchestrate multiple packages.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm node lerna bootstrap
```

### Running tests

```sh
docker-compose run --rm node lerna run test
```

### Running browser tests

#### Local

To run browser tests locally make sure `storybook-vue` is up and running. Navigate to `vue-components` subdirectory and run it with your storybook URL specified, e.g.
```sh
STORYBOOK_URL=localhost:6005 npm run e2e
```

#### Cross-browser testing

The cross browser tests for the `vue-components` package run on [Saucelabs](saucelabs.com). To connect to the Saucelabs servers you need an account. If you don't have it, please contact your manager.
Once you have an account, go to  https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings to check the username and access key.
Create an `.env` file like the `.env.example` one.

Then execute the e2e tests on Saucelabs. It might take a while to see the result in your terminal.
```sh
npm run e2e:saucelabs
```

:warning: Running browser tests in Docker doesn't work yet.

### Running Storybook

The following command starts two storybooks

* the storybook of the docs package - the Design System incl. documentation and tokens, on `DOCS_STORYBOOK_PORT`ยน
* the storybook of the vue-components package - an inventory of the component library, on `VUECOMPONENTS_STORYBOOK_PORT`ยน

```sh
docker-compose up
```

โน In development mode, the storybooks currently do **not** support "composition", i.e. vue-components is not featured in the docs storybook. Please look at it in isolation.

ยน Please refer to the `.env` file(s) for port configuration.

As usual, docker-compose also allows for those services to be started independently of each other if preferred.
