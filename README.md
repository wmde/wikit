The Wikibase Design System and home of WMDE-supported component implementations.

## Development

The following examples use `docker` and `docker-compose` to ease creating a level playing field for development but they are not essential to this project.

### Building the Docker image

```sh
# ensure the node user uses your user id, so you own created files
docker-compose build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) node
```

### Running npm

```sh
docker-compose run --rm node npm
```

### Installation

This project uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to orchestrate multiple packages.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm node lerna bootstrap
```

### Running tests

```sh
docker-compose run --rm node lerna run test
```

### Running Storybook

The following command starts two storybooks

* the storybook of the docs package - the Design System incl. documentation and tokens, on `DOCS_STORYBOOK_PORT`ยน
* the storybook of the vue-components package - an inventory of the component library, on `VUECOMPONENTS_STORYBOOK_PORT`ยน

```sh
docker-compose up
```

ยน Please refer to the `.env` file(s) for port configuration.

As usual, docker-compose also allows for those services to be started independently of each other if preferred.
