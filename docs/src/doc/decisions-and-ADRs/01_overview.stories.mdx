# Decisions and ADRs

Crucial decisions are documented in the form of Architecture Decision Records (or ADRs). Althought they usually cover topics exclusive to the dev realm, ADRs are very clearly written and structured in a standardized that generally makes them accessible to all the members of our cross-functional team.

## WiKit dev documentation

There is also some additional - very tech heavy - documentation contained in subfolders of the repository, usually right next to the place where a particular problem gets solved.

### Packages

The code of WiKit is organized into multiple packages, each tending to its own distinct task:

* docs - the docs you are looking at, this includes general documentation and demoing the other packages
* tokens - the Design Tokens which Wikit, as a Design system, is based on
* vue-components - the component library that implements the Design System

### Vue components

The library assumes it is going to be used in a Vue project, therefore Vue is externalized.
