# 8) CSS scoping

Date: 2020-07-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

CSS authors need to take care to not cause undesired global side effects by creating overly greedy selectors (e.g. styling certain tags on the whole page instead of just the desired ones).

Vue offers a built-in solution for this challenge called [component-scoped CSS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html#Component-Scoped-CSS). It [adds a data attribute](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/scoped-css.html#scoped-css) to all component's elements and extends the CSS selectors to match them.

As we are employing base CSS (see ADR #7) and - especially there - care needs to be taken to not accidentally create overly greedy selectors, we must find a solution for scoping it as well.

It is also the case that the developers of this feature team are used to and convinced by the approach of class-based styling as seen in our existing applications (e.g. [termbox](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/wikibase/termbox/+/0d4af4/docs/styles.md), bridge) where we follow the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology which results in a standardized naming scheme for component styles and for example helps debuggability (the classes inspectable in the web browser directly indicate the relevant component).

## Decision

We decided to not go with Vue's component-scoped CSS but instead
* prefix (e.g. through [prefixwrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-prefixwrap)) all our selectors with a dedicated class which scopes the style effects to the matching elements
* apply styling inside of the components through CSS classes unique across components

## Consequences

Components will be created without the `scoped` attribute on the style section of Single File Components.

As this is a component library and there is no shared `App` DOM node but components will be used in isolation, we will need a way (manual or automatic) to ensure that we consistently add the class matching the "prefix" to all component root elements.
