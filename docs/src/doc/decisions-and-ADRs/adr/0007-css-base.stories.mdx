# 7) CSS base

Date: 2020-07-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are in the process of implementing a component library. Those components are supposed to become portable manifestations of our Design System decisions which can get integrated into existing applications where needed.

This poses a challenge when users look at our components with user agents of different default styles, and when the applications - in which the components get embedded to - contain other styles (which were not developed with isolation in mind) already. We also want the developer experience during component development to be intuitive (no surprising base styles).

All component (style) development will happen on this foundation so it is important to make our component library robust and easy to contribute to.

## Decision

We decided that - even though inconsistent between user agent stylesheets are less of an issue today[0] than they were in the past - the need to address this challenge remains and doing so early in the process (before first styles are developed) is important to avoid bug reports and double effort.

We also decided that - while the definition of "intuitive" base style is arguably subjective - there is the need to have a base and its values have to be chosen carefully. While e.g. a reset of the margins of elements can help to ensure that the desired behavior correctly gets specified inside the component, un-styling the bold text of a `<strong>` tag may be unintuitive and cause confusion.

The decision was to employ best practices as seen in other popular open source software, e.g. [vuetify] and [bootstrap-vue], and - as documented there - go with a solution "to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements".

We also decided to trust the task of mitigating styles inherited from other greedy selectors to the individual users of our library. _If_ it is needed, then the applications will know best which concrete styles need compensation.

## Consequences

We have to decide for one of the existing technical solutions for this challenge, e.g. [ress], [normalize.css] or [bootstrap reboot].

Component development can happen against a stable base style. We must create a shared "namespace"/selector for our components in order to ensure that we apply the base styles only to the intended namespace under our control.

We will need this base style to be shipped alongside the component styles, and our users will need to consume it when using the components (if that means a separate include or not remains to be seen), just like we will use them when demoing the components in storybook.
