# Overview

The following documentation pages will give you detailed descriptions how to create new components for the WiKit library that can be reused by other teams as well. Before creating a new component, please check the existing components and consider whether you rather want to [Modify an existing components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-modify-existing-components--page#how-to-modify-existing-components) (the page gives an overview in which cases you might want to modify a component). 

For creating a new component, we see two main steps: [Designing Components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#1-designing-new-system-components) with designers as the target group for the documentation and [Developing Components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#developing-components) with developers as the target group for the documentation.



**The Designing Components page covers the following topics:**

- [designing new system components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#1-designing-new-system-components) (including the [design definition of done](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#15-the-design-definition-of-done))
- [using design tokens](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#2-using-design-tokens)
- [design handover to developers](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#3-design-handover)


**The Developing Components page covers the following topics:**

- [working with component level design tokens](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#working-with-component-level-design-tokens)
- [releasing a new component](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#releasing-a-new-component)
- [Testing Components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#testing-components)
