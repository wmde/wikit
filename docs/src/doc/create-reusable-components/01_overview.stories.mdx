# Overview

The following documentation pages will give you detailed descriptions on how to create new components for the WiKit library that can be reused by other teams as well. Before creating a new component, please check the existing components and consider whether you rather want to [Modify an existing component](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-modify-existing-components--page#how-to-modify-existing-components) (the page gives an overview of the cases in which you might want to modify a component). 

For creating a new component, we see two main steps: [Designing Components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#1-designing-new-system-components), with designers as the target group for the documentation, and [Developing Components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#developing-components), with developers as the target group for the documentation.



**The Designing Components page covers the following topics:**

- [Designing new system components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#1-designing-new-system-components) (including the [design definition of done](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#15-the-design-definition-of-done))
- [Using design tokens](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#2-using-design-tokens)
- [Design handover to developers](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page#3-design-handover)


**The Developing Components page covers the following topics:**

- [Working with component-level design tokens](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#working-with-component-level-design-tokens)
- [Releasing a new component](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#releasing-a-new-component)
- [Testing components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#testing-components)
