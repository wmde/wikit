# WiKit

This documents the work on the WiKit product, our Wikidata / Wikibase Design System.

The documentation is organized into these categories:

* How to modify existing components - if you want to change released components in this Storybook
* How to create reusable components - if you want to create a new system-compliant component
* Decisions and ADRs - if you want to understand technical decisions or why the process was defined as described

## Vue Components

The package `vue-components` is a user interface component library that implements the WiKit design system.
The library assumes it is going to be used in a Vue project, therefor Vue is externalized.
