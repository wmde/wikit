# WiKit

This documents the work on the WiKit product, our Wikidata / Wikibase Design System.

The documentation is organized into these categories:

* How to modify existing components - if you want to change released components in this Storybook
* How to create reusable components - if you want to create a new system-compliant component
* Decisions and ADRs - if you want to understand technical decisions or why the process was defined as described

## Working with GitHub

WiKit lives on GitHub. Anyone within the wmde GitHub org should be able to contribute to the repository.
If you don't have write access, please reach out to a manager.

### Branches

Name your branches using lowercase letters `[a-z]` and `-` or `_`, e.g. `improve-overview-doc`, `improve_overview_doc`.  
This is important, because the vue storybook is built and deployed to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=5efdb3b5f65950002286285d&branch=master) using the branch name.  
For example, if your branch is called `dropdown_component`, the vue storybook built on that branch will be deployed to  
https://dropdown_component--5efdb3b5f65950002286285d.chromatic.com  
This link is used by the cross-browser tests running on Saucelabs. If your branch name contains a character that is automatically changed by the browser (e.g. uppercase letters become lowercase letters), the tests will fail, because they won't be able to open the Chromatic link.

### Checks

All checks configured to run on each branch need to pass in order for the PR to be merged (the merge button will be inactive).

 - **Test and Deploy** - runs unit tests and linters, builds Storybook, deploys to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=5efdb3b5f65950002286285d&branch=master) and runs cross browser tests.
 - **Storybook Publish** - leads to the Storybook built on this branch and deployed to Chromatic.
 - **UI Tests** - leads to the Visual Tests feature on Chromatic which reports if there were any visual changes between master and the respective branch.

### Peer Reviews

At least one person (different than the author of the PR) has to approve the PR in order for the merge button to become active.
This is true regardless of the type of change - tokens, docs or vue-components.


### Merging to master

The master branch is the single source of truth for all three parts of the Design System - tokens, docs and vue-components.  
Nevertheless, when you are developing a new feature, you can safely merge to master, because the Design System does not get released automatically on push to master.
A release happens after several intentional actions a developer takes.  
You can read more about releases in the section [Releasing a new component](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#releasing-a-new-component).
