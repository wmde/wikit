# WiKit

This documents the work on the WiKit product, our Design System.

The documentation is organized into these categories:

* process - documentation which covers cross-trade work on this product
* UX - documentation which covers topics exclusive to the UX realm
* dev - documentation which covers topics exclusive to the dev realm

## Vue Components

The package `vue-components` is a user interface component library that implements the WiKit design system.
The library assumes it is going to be used in a Vue project, therefor Vue is externalized.
