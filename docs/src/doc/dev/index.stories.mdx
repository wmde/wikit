# Wikit dev documentation

Documentation which covers topics exclusive to the dev realm.

We are documenting our decisions as Architecture Decision Records. Please find them in `adr/`.

There is also some additional - very tech heavy - documentation contained in subfolders of the repository, usually right next to the place where a particular problem gets solved.

## Packages

The code of Wikit is organized into multiple packages, each tending to its own distinct task:

* docs - the docs you are looking at, this includes general documentation and demoing the other packages
* tokens - the Design Tokens which Wikit, as a Design system, is based on
