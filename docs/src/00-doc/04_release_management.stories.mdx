# Release Management

The Design System follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (also known as semver).

How to release a new version is documented in the section [Developing components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#releasing-a-new-component).

ℹ️ Changes to the `docs` package **do not** get released, because `docs` contains the documentation and token visualizations.

## Releasing a new component and/or new tokens

A version of the Design System and component library is released when the component and tokens are done and "ready" and the application wanting to use them makes use of the version in which they are contained.

## Releasing changes to an existing component or tokens

Design System changes are supposed to influence application styles, therefore a Design System change is not finished until it's propagated to all consuming applications.

## Breaking changes

Deciding if a change to the Design System is "breaking" is the responsibility of the developer(s) making the change.  
It is also their responsibility to inform other relevant roles like UX and PM (if the change is being made at their request) of that, so the additional effort of updating all consuming applications can be taken into consideration.

## Creating a pre-release 

If you want to be able to test components and features prior to their official release, you may create a pre-release. To make a pre-release you need to take the following steps: 
 - Ensure that all CI checks are passing on master
 - Create a new branch from master and switch to it. Hint: Do not name the branch the same as the expected tag name, to avoid a git reference conflict.
 - To release a new version, run the command `npm run bump-version -- [premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]`. This will take care of updating the version number in all package.json files.
 - Commit and push the changes you made to package files and open a PR.
 - After the PR is merged, create and push a new tag named after the version number with a "v" prefix and an `alpha` suffix, e.g. `v1.2.3-alpha.0` (0 stands for the first pre-release of this version, for each consecutive pre-release this number must be incremented).
 - Then go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/wmde/wikit/releases) in wikit's GitHub repository and click `Draft a new release`to create a new pre-release out of that tag.

  _**Note:** there is no need to describe the changes, as this is simply a pre release_.

  _**Important:** please make sure that the "This is a pre-release" checkbox is checked, otherwise a regular release will be made_.

 - Creating the new release will trigger a GitHub action, which will publish **both** the `tokens` and the `vue-components` packages under the `next` distribution tag on npm.
 - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/ to check the newly created versions.

_**Note:** after creating the pre-release, you can go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wmde/wikit-vue-components/v/{{ LATEST_VERSION}} (e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wmde/wikit-vue-components/v/2.0.0-alpha.9 ). If you don't see 404 on the page, that means the realse is in NPM. (if you see 404, wait a few minutes and refresh the page)_.


## Creating a release 

Once your changes are merged and you want to release a new version of the components library you need to take the following steps:
 - To release a new version run the command `npm run bump-version -- [major | minor | patch]`. This will take care of updating the version number in all package.json files.
 - Proofread and review the `CHANGELOG.md` file to ensure all changes are included (this will be later used in the release notes).
 - Rename the "[Unreleased]" heading in the chagelog file to the current version and Add a new "[Unreleased]" heading above it.
 - Commit and push the changes you made to package files and open a PR.
 - After the PR is merged create and push a new tag, named after the version number with a "v" prefix, e.g. `v1.2.3`. Alternatively you can use the npm provided tool [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)
 - Then go to the GitHub repository and create a new release out of that tag, describing what changed, like in the image below.

    _**Note**: You can copy the release notes over from the changelog file_

 - Creating the new release will trigger a GitHub action, which will publish **both** the `tokens` and the `vue-components` packages.
 - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/ to check the newly created versions.
