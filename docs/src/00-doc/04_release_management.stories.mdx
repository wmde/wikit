# Release Management

The Design System follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (also known as semver).

How to release a new verision is documented in the section [Developing components](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-developing-components--page#releasing-a-new-component).

ℹ️ Changes to the `docs` package **do not** get released, because `docs` contains the documentation and token visualizations.

## Releasing a new component and/or new tokens

A version of the Design System and component library is released when the component and tokens are done and "ready" and the application wanting to use them makes use of the version in which they are contained.

## Releasing changes to an existing component or tokens

Design System changes are supposed to influence application styles, therefore a Design System change is not finished until it's propagated to all consuming applications.

## Breaking changes

Deciding if a change to the Design System is "breaking" is the responsibility of the developer(s) making the change.  
It is also their responsibility to inform other relevant roles like UX and PM (if the change is being made at their request) of that, so the additional effort of updating all consuming applications can be taken into consideration.
