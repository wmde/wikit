## 1. Designing new system components

Due to the decentralized nature of our system, designers embedded in the different feature teams will be accountable for creating the final designs and specifications for new system components. The dedicated system designer (Sarai) will provide as much support as possible throughout the design process, which consists of the following recommended steps:

### 1.1. Discover

The designer in charge of the creation of the new system component should start by checking the [WiKit component library](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit?node-id=166%3A2), to see if the needed component has already been designed or can be designed based on any of the existing WiKit symbols.

It is advised that the designer performs an interface inventory by inspecting and capturing existing instances of the component in multiple sources: production (particularly Wikidata), OOUI and Wikimedia Foundation's [Design Style Guide](https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/components/links.html). Screenshots and specs of said instances should be collected in a central art board within the [Component Inventory](https://www.figma.com/file/QHIKwqfmSERr2fTqRj5UYM/Pattern%2FComponent-Inventory?node-id=0%3A1) in Figma. The purpose of the inventory is to achieve behavior parity, by making sure that all the specific interactive features of a given component are considered when creating a new system-compliant version.

### 1.2. Design

#### Visual style

All new components should follow the [system’s visual guidelines](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit-%F0%9F%94%A5?node-id=2510%3A3540), which are captured by the [color palette](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit-%F0%9F%94%A5?node-id=2510%3A3725), [typographic styles](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit-%F0%9F%94%A5?node-id=2510%3A3550) and premade [sizing and spacing](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit-%F0%9F%94%A5?node-id=2696%3A0).These guidelines are for now available only in Figma, but will also have their dedicated section in this Storybook.

While designing new system components, bear in mind to:

- Only use **colors** from the system’s color palette

- Only use pre-made **font styles**

- Apply pre-made widths and heights to define the **size** of components (e.g. height) and their elements (e.g. border widths)

- Whenever possible, base **spacing** (horizontal and vertical margins) on the 8px unit. Paddings may require smaller values: it’s ok to adjust them in order to preserve the right component sizing (e.g. height).

#### Interaction

Base component **interaction patterns** on the behaviour described in the [components’ documentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GB9WcQDQDYaf_kr0RvuaAuadKLPRytdcZ1vL78N2vx0/edit#slide=id.p)([See 1.4](#14-document)) in order to provide a consistent experience. Existing patterns (the behavior of the current version of the component in production) should also be evaluated and matched by the new version of the component in case they don’t contradict the system ([See 1.1](#11-discover)).

While defining the behaviour of new system components, bear in mind to:

- Consider **internazionalization needs** and make sure that the component is optimized for the various language sizes, display styles and orientations.

- Make sure to define the **responsive behaviour** of the component and to provide examples of its adaptation to different devices. 

- Follow **accessibility best practices** throughout the design process. You can check existing accessibility specs (e.g. keyboard navigation specifications) in the [components’ documentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GB9WcQDQDYaf_kr0RvuaAuadKLPRytdcZ1vL78N2vx0/edit#slide=id.p). We recommend observing the recommendations offered by the following resources as we should aim at providing at least an AA level of conformance:

   - [WAI-ARIA Authoring practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20190814/), by the W3C Working Group: Provides accessibility recomendations at a component level with links to examples created by the W3C in most cases.
   - [The A11Y Project Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
   - [WCAG guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/): Quick reference version of the extensive WCAG guidelines, with filtering options. 


### 1.3. Decide

The system designer will make herself available as needed to support you while making system-related design decisions. Nevertheless, it is important that, at any step of the design process, and necessarily before handover, the UX design team is involved in the definition and the review of the new system component. This is in order to align on the design decisions made, catch potential inconsistencies or improvements, and refine the whole component design process.

A crucial guiding factor in every design process is, of course, user feedback. Designers should assess the need to perform usability testing before and/or after the implementation of new components. They can opt for the most convenient testing modality in each case (moderated, unmoderated, attitudinal, behavioral), depending on the time and resources available.

### 1.4. Document

Throughout the design process, design decisions should be captured in the [_Specs and Documentation_](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit-%F0%9F%94%A5?node-id=2967%3A8) page in WiKit. The following essential documentation should be provided for every new system component in Figma:

- Give a distinctive **name** to the component and to its relevant typologies. When applicable, follow the naming structure “family variant/type/flavor”: e.g. “Quiet button” (component name), “Quiet button primary progressive” (component & typology name).

- Provide a **short description** of the overall purpose of the component.
Example: _“A notification is a one-way dialogue triggered instantly by a user action, usually to communicate success or failure as an outcome of said action.”_

- Capture the component interactive **states** (e.g. default, hover, active, focus, error, disabled), together with the user action that triggered them.

- Outline **visual specifications** (sizes, paddings, typographic styles, colors) of both the default and all component states. It should be possible to translate all these specifications using design tokens during handover ([See 3](#3-design-handover)).

- Define the **interactive features** that are essential to fully understand the component's behavior. In both cases, the user action leading to each state should also be specified.

- Include **responsive** behavior specifications

Designers should also provide more extended documentation about a component (anatomy, usage, interaction workflows, accessibility specs, etc) in the component’s [documentation file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GB9WcQDQDYaf_kr0RvuaAuadKLPRytdcZ1vL78N2vx0/edit?usp=sharing). More detailed behavior descriptions and good practices can be key to inform future design decisions ([See 1.2](#12-design)), and to help keeping the system’s interaction patterns consistent.

Again, you can count on the system designer to help with, or take over, component documentation.

Once a final version of the new design is agreed upon, the system designer will be responsible for the creation of a reusable, symbolized version of the component in the WiKit’s [UI Kit page](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit?node-id=166%3A2) in Figma.

### 1.5. The design definition of done

As it can be inferred from the previous sections, the design of new system components must comply with the following requirements in order to be considered done:

- All the visual and interactive design features of the component are **fully based on the preexisting design system’s guidelines** and documentation

- The design of the component and **all its interactive states** are fully represented in Figma, and all the component’s essential documentation is defined ([See 1.4](#14-document))

- [**Accessibility** guidelines](https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles_accessibility.html) have been considered

- **Responsive** behavior has been defined

- The final version of the component has been shared and **reviewed by other members of the design team**

- The totality of the component’s visual and interactive characteristics can be expressed using **design tokens** ([See 2](#2-using-design-tokens))

All the items on the previous list are a prerequisite to consider the component ready for handover ([See 3](#3-design-handover)).

## 2. Using design tokens

Design tokens have two main applications. They can mainly help designers to:

- **Define the visual style of components**: Since tokens capture the system’s styling patterns and premade decisions ([See 2.1](#21-introduction-what-are-design-tokens-in-the-context-of-the-wikidata-design-system)), they can provide guidance to designers working to define the styles (border and background colors, text styles, sizes, spacing) of new system components from scratch.

- **Create specs**: Once the design of the new component is ready, its styles will be outlined using design tokens ([See 2.2](#22-using-tokens-to-specify-a-new-component)). This is a necessary step of the handover process ([See 3](3-design-handover)).

### 2.1. Introduction: Design tokens in the context of the Wikidata/Wikibase design system

Design tokens are atoms that store the visual foundations of our design system. They codify colors, spacing, typographic styles, and even transitions in an agnostic and scalable way. The whole purpose of using tokens is to replace concrete values or single-use variables at a component level. They prevent deviations from the system’s visual and interactive properties, and make style modifications possible at scale and from a single source of truth.

In the context of the Wikidata design system (WiKit), tokens are stored using [JSON](https://github.com/wmde/wikit/tree/master/tokens/properties), and converted into actionable CSS variables that can be used to style components (via Style dictionary). Tokens are structured following three levels of granularity that reflect the chain of systematic decisions made, from high-level visual styles to specific component properties:

___Global tokens___ reflect the elementary visual foundations of the system. They are context agnostic (e.g. "accent-30").

___Alias tokens___ are abstractions that communicate the token’s intended use. They mostly represent styles that are shared among several components (e.g. "border-color-progressive-active") and take global tokens as values.

___Component-level tokens___ are created by developers and they represent every value associated with the style and interactive properties of a specific component (e.g. button-primary-progressive-border-color-active). They take alias tokens as values.

In order to ensure visual consistency between the WMDE and WMF projects, Wikidata’s global tokens use [wikimedia-ui-base.less](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/wikimedia-ui-base/+/refs/heads/master/wikimedia-ui-base.less) variables (defined by WMF) as values (rather than specific ones, such as #36c) whenever possible (the approach is explained in depth in  [ADR #2](https://wmde.github.io/wikit/?path=/docs/documentation-decisions-and-adrs-adrs-2-approach-for-reuse-of-variables-from-wikimedia-ui-base--page)).

### 2.2. Using tokens to specify a new component

Designers should only use tokens (aliases or globals) rather than concrete values (e.g. pixels or hex colors) to define the handover specs of any newly designed system component. Developers will then use the provided alias or global tokens to define the low-level component-specific tokens applied to style components ([See 3](#3-design-handover)).

A list of all the currently available global and alias design tokens can be found in the Design tokens section in this Storybook environment.

#### Selecting  tokens to define component specs

Throughout the specs' creation process,  all the component’s styling properties will need to be exhaustively defined. Designers should align with developers before handover in order to make sure that none of the component's properties is left unspecified.

**Example**

<center>
<img src="./images/button_specs.png" alt="a button with some specs" width="65%"/>
</center>

When creating  the button component above, we can identify the following visual and interactive properties:

- Height
- Vertical and horizontal padding
- Background color
- Border color
- Border radius
- Border width
- Button text (with its own styles)

In Storybook, tokens are classified in sections, depending on the styling property that they define (e.g. paddings, background color). Go through the token visualization pages to find and copy the alias or global tokens to be used as styling values for each one of the visual and interactive properties outlined in your handover file.

Following the previous example. After checking the token documentation, we could assign the following tokens to the outlined styles:

- Height: `$dimension-min-height-medium`
- Vertical and horizontal padding: `$padding-horizontal-medium`, `$padding-horizontal-medium`
- Background color: `$background-color-neutral-default`
- Border color: `$border-color-neutral-default`
- Border radius: `$border-color-neutral-default`
- Border width: `$border-width-thin`
- Button text (with its own styles): `$font-family-style-label`, `$font-weight-bold`, `$font-size-style-label`, `$font-line-height-style-label`.

#### Using alias v. global tokens

<center>
<img src="./images/token_use.png" alt="" width="65%"/>
</center>

Use alias tokens to define specs whenever possible: they represent the styling patterns that all system components should follow.
There may be exceptions, though, when you’ll have to use global tokens. For example, to define single-use styles that only apply to an individual component, and for which a styling pattern has not (yet) been detected.

👉🏻  Please note that alias tokens are context-specific, so try to use them accordingly to the intended purpose expressed by their name:

<center>
<img src="./images/do_dont.png" alt="an example how how to use and how not to use alias tokens" width="75%"/>
</center>

It is important to bear in mind that not all patterns could be detected or all design decisions could be anticipated when creating our first batch of tokens. In order to reflect further design decisions as the system matures, tokens will need to be updated and, in some cases, also created.

#### Suggesting the creation of new tokens

As mentioned, if none of the existing alias tokens can provide the right value for a given style, designers can exceptionally use global tokens instead. Nevertheless, in case a visual pattern is detected (i.e. a given global token is used or will be used from now on to define a particular style that is shared by at least two components), the recommendation would be to create a new alias token that reflects that systemic decision, so it can be used from now on.

When suggesting the creation of missing tokens, the following process is advised:

- Bring up your findings and proposal to your friendly system designer (Sarai) for it to be evaluated
- The proposal will be shared with the UX team for review and alignment
- Once the new token is introduced in the system, you and the rest of the design team will be notified

Although unlikely, it may happen that the newly needed alias token does not yet have a global representation. In that case, a new global token would be created together with its alias. New global tokens will also be introduced in case a major redesign or style change is imposed by the Wikimedia Foundation.

## 3. Design handover

Figma is the agreed-upon handover environment. In order to collect specs in a centralized way, designers should create a new documentation frame in the _Specs and documentation_ page, and name it after their “Component_Variant” [see example](https://www.figma.com/file/gi3JYwSUQYhKS0mHwK25cQwi/WiKit-%F0%9F%94%A5?node-id=3348%3A259)). A link to said specifications' frame should be shared in the appropriate Phabricator ticket.

Many of the handover items should already be covered if the design process has been followed. At this point, though, it is essential to make sure that the collected information really covers the needs of developers, and that it is expressed in a clear and distinct way. An effective handover documentation provides developers with:

- Component specs that are fully outlined using tokens (as defined in 1.4):<br/>
  - **Visual** specification (sizes, paddings, typographic styles, colors) are fully defined using design tokens ([See 2.2](#22-using-tokens-to-specify-a-new-component)).
  - **States**’ specifications (e.g. default, hover, active, focus, error, disabled) and **interactive behavior** are defined and fully specified. In both cases, the user actions leading to each state should also be indicated.
  - **Responsive** behavior specifications are also outlined <br/>
<br/>

👉🏻 The system designer will be in charge of creating and making available, before development, the component-level token files based on the design specifications.

- Basic component documentation (as defined in 1.4):<br/>
  - A distinctive **name** for the component and its relevant typologies
  - A **short description** of the overall purpose of the component<br/>
  - **Accessibility** specifications, such as keyboard navigation, are defined<br/>
  <br/>
- Storybook indications:<br/>
  - Specify where, within the current **Storybook structure**, the component should be classified (new dedicated section or subsection), based on the relationship to its component family (this relationship should also be expressed by the name).
  - Indicate the required Storybook **controls**, if needed: these allow users to modify some properties of a component in real time.<br/>
  <br/>
- **Assets** used by components (e.g. icons) should be included in Figma, but ideally these should be exported in an svg format and attached to the component story in Phabricator, to make them directly available for download. <br/>

👉🏻  Designers should dedicate time to go through handover files with the developers in their hike in order to make sure that the documentation is intelligible and well structured for everyone, and to detect potential missing requirements before moving into implementation.
