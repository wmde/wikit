# Developing Components

Due to the decentralized nature of the design system, developers embedded in different feature teams will be accountable for creating new components to use in the feature they are building.

The following is a set of instructions on different topics that might come up during the process of developing a new component:

* [Step by step workflow](#step-by-step-workflow)<br/>
* [Working with Component-level Design Tokens](#working-with-component-level-design-tokens)<br/>
    * [Getting better editor support for token files](#getting-better-editor-support-for-token-files)<br />
* [Testing Components](#testing-components)<br/>
    * [Working with browser tests](#working-with-browser-tests)<br/>
    * [Working with visual regression tests](#working-with-visual-regression-tests)<br/>

## Step by step workflow

0. Gather relevant global and/or alias tokens.
0. Create component-level tokens as described below.
0. Create the vue component and write unit tests.
0. Create component stories in the vue-components storybook.
0. Create browser tests if needed (more info below).
0. Open a PR and look at the UI Tests in Chromatic to check the results from the visual regression tests.
0. Ask UX for a review.
0. Ask a fellow developer for a technical review.
0. Make a new release after the PR is merged to master.


## Working with Component-level Design Tokens

A general overview of how we use design tokens in our design system can be found in the "Using design tokens" section of the [design documentation](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page). While global and alias tokens are created by system designers, the creation of component-level tokens is part of the component implementation and thus the responsibility of developers.

All component-level tokens must reference alias and global tokens listed in the design specification. This way, they act as a check for the completeness of the design specification.

The name of a component-level token file should match the name of the component. For example, a component implemented in `Button.vue` should have a `Button.json` containing its tokens.

The recommended naming scheme for individual tokens is `wikit-<ComponentName>-[prop-][element-][state-]<css-property>` - increasing specificity from left to right. The order depends on the context however; states should follow the element on which the interaction occurred.

**For example**: 

A "hover" on the "menu-item" impacting the "menu-item" style yields 

<code>wikit-Dropdown-progressive-<strong>menu-item-hover</strong>-background-color</code>

While a "hover" on the "Dropdown" component impacting the "menu-item" style yields

<code>wikit-<strong>Dropdown-progressive-hover</strong>-menu-item-background-color</code>

### Getting better editor support for token files

By generating a JSON schema describing the structure of token files and including all token names we make it possible for text editors to provide autocompletion in token JSON files. This is especially useful for token references (e.g. `{font.line-height.style.label.value}`) which would otherwise be typed by hand.

Letting the text editor know which JSON files to apply the schema to requires some configuration.

#### VS Code

VS Code has good [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) on getting better editor support for JSON files and working with JSON schemas. TL;DR modify and copy the following into your JSON workspace settings:

```json
{
    "json.schemas": [
        {
            "fileMatch": [
                "tokens/properties/**/*.json"
            ],
            "url": "./tokens/dist/schema.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### JetBrains products
Go to Settings and navigate to `Languages & Frameworks` > `Schemas and DTDs` >  `JSON Schema Mappings`. There you'll be able to create a mapping for the token files with the schema pointing to `./tokens/dist/schema.json` and the directory set to `tokens/properties/`.

## Testing Components

### Working with browser tests

The browser tests spec `Button.test.js` is there to give an example of how to write a browser test with Nightwatch (the browser tests framework being used).  
Use the custom function `openComponentStory()` to load the component you want to test on Storybook, e.g. `.openComponentStory( 'button' )`.  
Do not execute `client.end()` at the end of your browser test. This is done in the `afterEach` hook defined in `globals.js`. If you do that, Saucelabs will not get the correct status of the tests and will show `failed` in the README badges.

If you want to read more about (cross)browser tests please refer to [ADR #10](?path=/story/documentation-decisions-and-adrs-adrs-10-browser-testing--page)

### Working with visual regression tests

As a developer, you don't need to write specs for the visual regression tests. Everything is done by [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=5efdb3b5f65950002286285d)'s Visual Tests feature.

Once you introduce a new component, Chromatic will detect the difference and will ask you to accept the component's snapshot as a base one.  
Any further changes will be considered a failure in the visual tests. One has to accept them in Chromatic's UI.  
Everyone in the GitHub wmde org has access to WiKit's Chromatic project. You only need to log in with your GitHub account.
