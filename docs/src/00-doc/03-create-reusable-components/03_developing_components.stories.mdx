# Developing Components

Due to the decentralized nature of the design system, developers embedded in different feature teams will be accountable for creating new components to use in the feature they are building.

The following is a set of instructions on different topics that might come up during the process of developing a new component:

* [Step by step workflow](#step-by-step-workflow)<br/>
* [Working with Component-level Design Tokens](#working-with-component-level-design-tokens)<br/>
* [Releasing a new component](#releasing-a-new-component)<br/>
* [Testing Components](#testing-components)<br/>
    * [Working with browser tests](#working-with-browser-tests)<br/>
    * [Working with visual regression tests](#working-with-visual-regression-tests)<br/>

## Step by step workflow

0. Gather relevant global and/or alias tokens.
0. Create component-level tokens as described below.
0. Create the vue component and write unit tests.
0. Create component stories in the vue-components storybook.
0. Create browser tests if needed (more info below).
0. Open a PR and look at the UI Tests in Chromatic to check the results from the visual regression tests.
0. Ask UX for a review.
0. Ask a fellow developer for a technical review.
0. Make a new release after the PR is merged to master.


## Working with Component-level Design Tokens

A general overview of how we use design tokens in our design system can be found in the "Using design tokens" section of the [design documentation](?path=/story/documentation-how-to-create-reusable-components-designing-components--page). While global and alias tokens are created by system designers, the creation of component-level tokens is part of the component implementation and thus the responsibility of developers.

All component-level tokens must reference alias and global tokens listed in the design specification. This way, they act as a check for the completeness of the design specification.

The name of a component-level token file should match the name of the component. For example, a component implemented in `Button.vue` should have a `Button.json` containing its tokens.

The recommended naming scheme for individual tokens is `wikit-<ComponentName>-[prop-][state-]<css-property>` - increasing specificity from left to right. A token containing the background-color (CSS property) value of a hovered (state) progressive (prop) button (component name) should be called `wikit-Button-progressive-hover-background-color`. Default prop values and states can be omitted from the name. A border-radius token that applies to all button types in all states can simply be named `wikit-Button-border-radius`.

## Releasing a new component

Once your changes are merged and you want to release a new version of the components library you need to take the following steps:
 - To release a new version run the command `lerna version [major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]`. This will take of updating the version number, committing and pushing the changes.
[lerna version docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/version). Wait for the PR to be merged.
 - After it's merged create and push a new tag, named after the version number with a "v" prefix, e.g. `v1.2.3`. Alternatively you can use the npm provided tool [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)
 - Then go to the GitHub repository and create a new release out of that tag, describing what changed, like in the image below.

<center>
    <img src="./images/docs_release_example.png" alt="release example on github"/>
</center>

 - Creating the new release will trigger a GitHub action, which will publish **both** the `tokens` and the `vue-components` packages.
 - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/ to check the newly created versions.

## Testing Components

### Working with browser tests

The browser tests spec `Button.test.js` is there to give an example of how to write a browser test with Nightwatch (the browser tests framework being used).  
Use the custom function `openComponentStory()` to load the component you want to test on Storybook, e.g. `.openComponentStory( 'button' )`.  
Do not execute `client.end()` at the end of your browser test. This is done in the `afterEach` hook defined in `globals.js`. If you do that, Saucelabs will not get the correct status of the tests and will show `failed` in the README badges.

If you want to read more about (cross)browser tests please refer to [ADR #10](?path=/story/documentation-decisions-and-adrs-adrs-10-browser-testing--page)

### Working with visual regression tests

As a developer, you don't need to write specs for the visual regression tests. Everything is done by [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=5efdb3b5f65950002286285d)'s Visual Tests feature.

Once you introduce a new component, Chromatic will detect the difference and will ask you to accept the component's snapshot as a base one.  
Any further changes will be considered a failure in the visual tests. One has to accept them in Chromatic's UI.  
Everyone in the GitHub wmde org has access to WiKit's Chromatic project. You only need to log in with your GitHub account.
