# 12) Remove predefined component widths

Date: 2020-11-10

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Originally, block-level system components – those which size is not defined by their content (e.g. input field) – were designed and implemented following a set of predefined default widths based on the system's spacing unit (the most common size being 256px, for example). 
These components were also designed and implemented to take a "full-width" value as a prop, intended to make them responsive and adjustable to their context via their containers.

While these predefined widths were purely provided as orientation, we inferred that they might be unused after all due to the variability of contexts in which components can be implemented. 
Making components full-width by default would simplify things: making them more versatile, responsive and adjustable to the layout of their application. 

## Considered actions

### 1. Keep predefined widths, but make "full-width" the default value.

This conservative approach would make block-level components "full-width" by default via prop. Predefined width values are still available to be applied.

### 2. Get rid of widths entirely and make components' sizes to be limited to the full width of their parent element.

This involves removing all predefined widths and width props. As long as they're block-level, components will take the width of their container.

## Decision

Remove width props and make component widths 100% by default, so their final width is defined in context, by their layout elements. 
Implementers will still be able to use system dimension tokens to size the containers in their application.

## Consequences

At this initial state, WiKit doesn't provide a layout or grid system. This means that the decision regarding the specific width of components is delegated to the designers and the developers implementing the WiKit Design system.
