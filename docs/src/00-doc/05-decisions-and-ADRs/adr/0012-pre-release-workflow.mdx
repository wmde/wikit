# 0012) Pre-Release Workflow

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Status

options: draft

## Context

The Design System was released as version 1.0.0 after the initial simple Button component was finished.
This has the effect that all future breaking changes require a new major version release according to semantic versioning,
as opposed to not making a commitment to stability yet [as it would have been true for 0.x releases](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).
This means that we need to ensure that every release contains stable, finished components in their own rights.

Some Design System components are so complex, that they cannot be reasonably released partially.
Yet, some work-in-progress feature development is blocked by those components not being available at all.
For that feature development it is good enough to have a partial component now,
as long it is done and properly released when the feature development is finished.

Conversely, finishing the development and finding incomplete requirements/design would benefit from the partial component being actually used somewhere.
