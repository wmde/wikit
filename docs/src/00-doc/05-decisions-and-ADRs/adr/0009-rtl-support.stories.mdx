# 9) RTL support

Date: 2020-07-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context
The components library has to support text in Right-to-Left (RTL) scripts.
In the past the challenge of writing styles which work in LTR and RTL scripts was solved by tools which take a stylesheet developed in a LTR-mindset and flip it for RTL.
Such tools include but are not limited to [cssjanus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssjanus), [rtlcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtlcss), [rtl-css-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtl-css-js).

In the recent past (2018) [CSS Logical Properties and Values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) was introduced. As MDN web docs describe it, it's a module of CSS introducing logical properties and values that provide the ability to control layout through logical, rather than physical, direction and dimension mappings.
This approach solves the double support for LTR and RTL scripts. Instead of writing 2 stylesheets, we can now write one, which defines the correct directionality regardless of the direction of the text.

We identified two challenges:
- [No IE11 support as of date](https://caniuse.com/#search=logical)
- Make sure future contributors don't write directional style rules, e.g. `margin-left` instead of `margin-start`

Fortunately, both problems have solutions in the form of postcss plugins ([postcss-logical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-logical), [postcss-dir-pseudo-class](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-dir-pseudo-class)) and a stylelint plugin ([stylelint-use-logical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-use-logical)).

### RTL support for icons
Neither of the tools and solutions discussed above concern themselves with icons.

#### Symmetrical icons
Symmetrical icons donâ€™t need to be flipped between LTR and RTL layouts.

#### Non-symmetrical icons
Non-symmetrical icons can be flipped (with css transform, e.g. [data-bridge button](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/Wikibase/+/refs/heads/master/client/data-bridge/src/presentation/components/EventEmittingButton.vue#289)) for RTL scripts.  
They can also be provided with two separate `svg`s - one for LTR and one for RTL. The correct `svg` should be loaded based on the `dir` attribute.  

There are exceptions to the rule, like [media player icons](https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling/#media-player-icons).

The following guides might be useful when dealing with RTL support for icons:  
- [Material Design - mirroring elements](https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements)  
- [RTL Styling - bidirectional icons](https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling/#bidirectional-icons)

## Decision
Use CSS Logical Properties and Values.  
Decide if an icon should change based on the directionality per case.

## Consequences
Using logical properties gives us native browser support for RTL styling.
We cannot use the shorthand `margin` or `padding` for now, because it implies a LTR directionality and is [not supported yet](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1282) in the logical properties.
