# WiKit docs

This package holds the Wikit documentation and tools needed to produce it.

It holds both visualizations of the [design tokens](../tokens) in the system as well as stories showing implemented [vue-components](../vue-components). 

We implemented the documentation using storybook. It gets built for each commit, where it can be used - as part of the UX verification workflow - and published upon merge into the main line, where it serves as canonical documentation of the current state of the Design System.
